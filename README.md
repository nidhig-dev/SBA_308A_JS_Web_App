## Objective
 A small web page application for all Harry Potter fans. It will display information about all the books and the characters in it.
 ## Functionality
 
* When the page loads, the drop down will display all the published harry potter books from web api. When you choose one of them, it will display the cover page and some information about the book.
* Get Cast button will take the value from the search button and based on the entered character name, display info about the character.

## Validation
- If text box is empty, console.log error.
- If character name entered is incorrect, alert pops up.

## Requirement

- ✅Use the fetch API or Axios to communicate with an external web API. Use the data provided by this API to populate your application’s content and features.

- ✅Create user interaction with the API through a search feature, paginated gallery, or similar. This feature should use GET requests to retrieve associated data.

- ✅Make use of Promises and async/await syntax as appropriate.

- ✅Organize your JavaScript code into at least three (3) different module files, and import functions and data across files as necessary.

- ✅Ensure the program runs as expected, without any undesired behavior caused by misunderstanding of the JavaScript event loop (such as race conditions, API calls being handled out of order, etc.).

- ✅Create an engaging user experience through the use of HTML and CSS.

- ✅Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things that do not work, and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial credit).

- ✅Commit frequently to the git repository.

- ✅Include a README file that contains a description of your application.

- ✅Level of effort displayed in creativity, presentation, and user experience.

## Reflection


- What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?
   - I could have planned all my event listeners functionalities better. I could think of two scenarios only which reused the create img and create info paragraph. I could have planned to incorporate more functionalities.

- What would you add to, or change about your application if given more time?

    - I would have added spells and house info as well but trying to keep the page one had its drawbacks and I ran out of time. I could have added links in nav bar if I had time.
